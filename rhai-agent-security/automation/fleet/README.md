# Fleet SAW deployment

Scriptable form of the Secure Agent Workspace install for Red Hat Demo
Platform orders (~50 clusters). This is the **SAW as script** path: the same
procedure participants run in module 3, looped over clusters. The SAW fork's
procedure stays canonical — these scripts only loop it and never duplicate
fork logic.

## Division of labor

| Path | What | Where |
|---|---|---|
| RHDP order gitops path | workshop prerequisites (capstone child) | `../argocd` — the order deploys the workshop chart |
| Fleet script (this dir) | SAW install per cluster | `fleet-install.sh` |
| Manual (module 3) | participant-run SAW install | the SAW fork's documented procedure |

The workshop GitOps (RHDP chart) works in any order: the order deploys the
capstone child at order time and it retries until this script has installed
SAW on the cluster.

## One-time setup (shared across all clusters)

```bash
# 1. Fork checkout (one local clone is reused for every cluster):
mkdir -p ~/git && git clone --branch saw-emulation-fixes \
  https://github.com/taylorjordanNC/secure-agent-workspace.git ~/git/secure-agent-workspace

# 2. Secret values file (see the SAW fork install doc for the content):
cp ~/git/secure-agent-workspace/values-secret.yaml.template ~/values-secret.yaml

# 3. SSH keypair (one keypair is reused for every cluster):
cd ~/git/secure-agent-workspace && make generate-keys
```

## Credentials

```bash
cp clusters.csv.example clusters.csv   # gitignored — fill in from the RHDP order
```

`clusters.csv` holds cluster-admin logins. It is gitignored; never commit it,
and keep it off shared hosts.

## Install

```bash
./fleet-install.sh                       # sequential, apply-and-move-on
./fleet-install.sh --only workshop-01    # bootstrap ONE cluster (facilitator
                                         # remedy): install, then block until the
                                         # module-7-prereqs Application is
                                         # Synced/Healthy — participants proceed
                                         # the moment it returns
./fleet-install.sh --jobs 5              # 5 parallel workers
./fleet-install.sh --wait                # block per cluster until the setup Job completes
./fleet-install.sh --no-emulation        # KVM-capable clusters only
./fleet-install.sh --dry-run             # print the plan, change nothing
```

Even a single cluster goes through `clusters.csv`: `--only NAME` matches the
`name` column (exactly one row required), and `fleet-status.sh` reads the
same file.

Per cluster the script runs the fork's documented steps, in order:
`make copy-images` → `./pattern.sh make install` → HCO software-emulation
annotate (idempotent; skipped with `--no-emulation`) → optional setup-Job
wait. After the install returns, VM setup continues in-cluster for ~1-3h.

Observed per-cluster wall time: `copy-images` ~10-15 min + the pattern
GitOps health loop ~30-50 min → roughly 50-70 min per cluster. For a
50-cluster order: sequential ≈ 2 days — use `--jobs`: 5 workers ≈ 10h,
10 workers ≈ 5h. Each worker takes a stride through `clusters.csv`, so
clusters never overlap and never install twice.

Parallel workers each clone the fork into `.workers/` — the
Validated Patterns framework writes state in the checkout, so one clone
cannot serve two clusters at once. Each worker also gets its own
kubeconfig (`~/.saw-fleet/worker-N.kubeconfig`): `oc login` flips the
current context in a shared kubeconfig, so concurrent installs sharing
one would send each other's helm calls at the wrong cluster. The caller's
own login is never modified.

**Before `--jobs > 1`: commit and push local fork changes.** Worker clones
come from the fork repository, so uncommitted local fixes (e.g. the
Apple-Silicon `pattern.sh` platform fix) are missing from them and the
install breaks on arm64 hosts.

## Status

```bash
./fleet-status.sh            # poll every cluster in clusters.csv
./fleet-status.sh --current  # poll only the current oc context
```

Shows Argo CD Applications (sync/health), the SAW VM phase, the setup Job,
and the workshop namespaces per cluster.

The gate (`--gate`) passes apps that are Healthy even when OutOfSync — the
SAW pattern and the workshop chart both manage parity-declared objects
(`rhods-operator`, `kubevirt-hyperconverged`), so expected annotation drift
keeps those apps OutOfSync while Healthy. Only a not-Healthy app (Degraded,
Progressing, Missing) or a missing workshop namespace fails the gate.

## Troubleshooting

**Golden-image import stuck in ImagePullBackOff** (VM never provisions, DV
`*-golden` phase ImportScheduled): the setup Job's golden-image import pulls
`:latest` from the internal registry. Fork revisions before the mirror-tag
fix push only the pinned version tag, so `:latest` never exists. Tag it
manually and the crash-looping CDI importer retries:

```bash
oc tag openshell-agents/openshell-gateway-docker:<version> \
  openshell-agents/openshell-gateway-docker:latest
```

Fixed upstream in the fork (`fix(mirror): tag mirrored images as :latest`)
— only needed on clusters pinned to older fork revisions.

**Agent model calls (the SAW inference path)**: the gateway-side provider is
wired for the supported provider types — the default is NVIDIA's
`nvidia/nemotron-3-super-120b-a12b` via the shared NGC key
(`provider: build` in `values-secret.yaml`), served at
`integrate.api.nvidia.com`. Verified live: the key works at that endpoint
and the model completes. Two limitations found during a live run, both in
the OpenShell gateway/nemoclaw plugin (upstream, not this repository):

* the plugin registers the provider **type's** default endpoint and ignores
  a re-pointed `endpoint` config — custom OpenAI-compatible endpoints (e.g.
  a Model-as-a-Service gateway) do not work end-to-end;
* a provider credential update does **not** propagate to existing sandboxes —
  the sandbox's injected `NVIDIA_API_KEY` env is frozen at sandbox creation,
  so rotate credentials by re-creating the sandboxes (or provision fresh
  clusters with the final key).

Module 8 is unaffected: the guardrails chart calls its Model-as-a-Service
endpoint directly, no gateway-side provider involved.

## Environment knobs

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `SAW_DIR` | `~/git/secure-agent-workspace` | fork checkout (sequential mode) |
| `SAW_REF` | `saw-emulation-fixes` | fork revision (`--jobs` clones) |
| `SAW_GITOPS_NS` | `openshift-gitops` | SAW pattern Argo CD namespace (status) |
| `SAW_NS` | `openshell-agents` | SAW namespace |
| `CSV` | `clusters.csv` | credentials file |

Credentials rows are `name,server,username,password[,token]` — an optional
5th token column logs in with a bearer token instead of username/password
(e.g. for SNOs that only expose tokens).

If the SAW fork changes its Argo CD instance namespace, update `SAW_GITOPS_NS`
here and the `saw_gitops_namespace` attribute in both Antora `antora.yml`
files (parity-checked by `npm run validate:docs`).
